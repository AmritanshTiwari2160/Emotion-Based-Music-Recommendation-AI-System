# Emotion-Based Music Recommendation AI SystemðŸŽµðŸ˜ƒ

An AI-driven web application that detects user emotions through facial expressions and recommends music accordingly. This project leverages computer vision, deep learning, and web development technologies to create an interactive and engaging user experience.

**Key Features:**
1. Real-time Emotion Detection: Uses OpenCV and a Haarcascade classifier to detect faces and analyze emotions in real-time.
2. Deep Learning Model: A pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) built with Keras to predict emotions from facial expressions.
3. Music Recommendation: Recommends music based on detected emotions, selected singer, and preferred language by directing users to relevant YouTube videos.
4. Interactive Web Interface: Developed with Flask to provide a seamless user interface for selecting preferences and viewing recommendations.
   
**Technologies Used:** </br>
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript</br>
Backend: Flask (Python)</br>
Machine Learning: Keras, TensorFlow</br>
Computer Vision: OpenCV</br>
Deployment: Webbrowser module for opening YouTube links
